This simple note taking application allows you to save notes with a title and plain text. Powered by ExpressJS, the Note Taker app makes creating, viewing, and deleting notes a cinch!

### <center>*Getting Started*</center>

User launchs the application they are asked to describe the first member of their team.  The user then enters the team member's name and selects that member's role from a list: Engineer,Intern and Manager. User then enters: the member's ID, enters the member's email address and they must enter another piece of information that will depend on what role the User selected.  If Engineer was selected the app asks for the users team member's GitHub username. If Intern was selected the team members school is requested. 




### <center>*Approach Tech*</center>


This app was created using OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). Using constructors and classes to create team member profile objects based on information entered by the User.  The application is run off nodeJs and uses the Inquirer and Filing System nodeJs modules. Objects of files should also be stored in separate JS files and passed among one another using module.exports and require.
